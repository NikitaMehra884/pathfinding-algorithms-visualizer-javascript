# pathfinding-algorithms-visualizer-javascript
This web-based Pathfinding Visualizer shows how four core algorithms—BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Floyd-Warshall—work in real time on a 2D grid. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it helps users visualize how each algorithm finds paths between nodes.


🔍 What It Does
The visualizer simulates the step-by-step process of four important graph algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS) – Explores neighbors level by level; ideal for unweighted graphs.

Depth-First Search (DFS) – Explores as far as possible along a path before backtracking.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Finds the shortest path in graphs with weighted edges.

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm – Computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.

Each algorithm runs in real time with smooth animations that highlight the visited nodes and final path.

🧱 Key Features
Click to place Start, End, and Walls

Visual, step-by-step animation for each algorithm

Grid reset and algorithm switch options

Mobile-friendly responsive design

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Builds the layout and grid structure

CSS – Styles the grid and animations

JavaScript – Implements the logic of all four algorithms and handles UI interactions

🎯 Purpose
The visualizer is useful for:

Students learning data structures and algorithms

Educators demonstrating algorithm behavior

Developers needing a visual reference for pathfinding techniques
